# Container With Most Water

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `ith` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return  *the maximum amount of water a container can store*.

 **Notice**  that you may not slant the container.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- n == height.length
- 2 <= n <= 105
- 0 <= height[i] <= 104

public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {

        int maxWater=0;
        int l=0;
        int r= height.size()-1;

        while(l<r){

            int water= min(height[l],height[r])*(r-l);

            maxWater=max(maxWater,water);

            if(height[l]<height[r]){
                l++;
            }
            else{
                r--;
            }

        }

        return maxWater;
        

    }
};
```
