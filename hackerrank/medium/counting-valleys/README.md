# Counting Valleys

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

An avid hiker keeps meticulous records of their hikes. During the last hike that took exactly $steps$ steps, for every step it was noted if it was an *uphill*, $U$, or a *downhill*, $D$ step. Hikes always start and end at sea level, and each step up or down represents a $1$ unit change in altitude. We define the following terms:

- A *mountain* is a sequence of consecutive steps *above* sea level, starting with a step *up* from sea level and ending with a step *down* to sea level.  
- A *valley* is a sequence of consecutive steps *below* sea level, starting with a step *down* from sea level and ending with a step *up* to sea level.

Given the sequence of *up* and *down* steps during a hike, find and print the number of *valleys* walked through. 

**Example**  

$steps = 8$
$path=[DDUUUUDD]$  

The hiker first enters a valley $2$ units deep.  Then they climb out and up onto a mountain $2$ units high.  Finally, the hiker returns to sea level and ends the hike.  

**Function Description**  

Complete the *countingValleys* function in the editor below.  

countingValleys has the following parameter(s):  

- *int steps*: the number of steps on the hike  
- *string path*: a string describing the path  

**Returns**  

- *int:*  the number of valleys traversed 

**Input Format**

The first line contains an integer $steps$, the number of steps in the hike. 	
The second line contains a single string $path$, of $steps$ characters that describe the path.

**Constraints**

- $2 \leq steps \leq 10^6$  
- $path[i] \in \{UD\}$

**Output Format**

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

string ltrim(const string &);
string rtrim(const string &);

/*
 * Complete the 'countingValleys' function below.
 *
 * The function is expected to return an INTEGER.
 * The function accepts following parameters:
 *  1. INTEGER steps
 *  2. STRING patht
 */

int countingValleys(int steps, string path) {
    int sealevel=0;
    int valley=0;
    for(char step:path){
        if(step=='U')
            sealevel++;
        else if (step=='D')
            sealevel--;
        if(step=='U'&&sealevel==0)
            valley++;
    }
    return valley;

}

int main()
{
    ofstream fout(getenv("OUTPUT_PATH"));

    string steps_temp;
    getline(cin, steps_temp);

    int steps = stoi(ltrim(rtrim(steps_temp)));

    string path;
    getline(cin, path);

    int result = countingValleys(steps, path);

    fout << result << "\n";

    fout.close();

    return 0;
}

string ltrim(const string &str) {
    string s(str);

    s.erase(
        s.begin(),
        find_if(s.begin(), s.end(), not1(ptr_fun<int, int>(isspace)))
    );

    return s;
}

string rtrim(const string &str) {
    string s(str);

    s.erase(
        find_if(s.rbegin(), s.rend(), not1(ptr_fun<int, int>(isspace))).base(),
        s.end()
    );

    return s;
}
